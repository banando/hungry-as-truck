##Synopsis


Our app is for connecting hungry people with food trucks. Hungry people will be able to log in and see the most up-to-date information about the locations of food trucks near them or specify other locations where they would like to find food trucks. Truck owners will be able to update hungry people instantly about the locations of their trucks.

##Motivation

There are other food trucks apps out there but they are ugly, clunky and not optimized for mobile use. Our app is streamlined, intuitive to use, and geared toward mobile use. No other food truck app connects food trucks and hungry people as directly as ours.
